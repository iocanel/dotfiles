## motivation

I keep on loosing my workstation configuration files all the time!
Sometimes, I am backing them up, but when I need them the backup is always so out of date!
Even when I scheduled an automated process for encrypting and uploading to the cloud, I somehow messed up with the keys!

So, the only real way of preserving them, is to treat them as code and push them on github...

## structure

This is actually my home directory, with everything on .gitignore besides the things that I actually want to share.
To avoid sharing `sensitive informatio` [password store](https://password-store.org) is used whenever possible.
