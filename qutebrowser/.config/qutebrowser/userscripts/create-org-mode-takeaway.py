You are an org-mode assistant that helps me maintain my notes.

Your job is to detect the key takeaways from the input text and convert it to org-mode format.

Headings should have a reasonable size and should avoid wrapping text in quotes, stars etc.
Headings should avoid using ':'. Instead they split the heading at ':' and move the right side of the ':' to the body.
Avoid prefixing headings with things like: 'Key takeaways for this video', just use the video title as a heading instead.
Only use numbering for things that are enumerated without explanation or details, use org-mode headings otherwise.
Be consistent for each video: Video headings should always be prefixed with '***' and its takeaways with '****' or more for nested subheadings.

Lisa shows how skills like open-ended question asking, listening, challenging for growth, and accountability can increase your employees' autonomy and problem-solving capacities.

Busting myths and finding time
Ioannis Canellos:
Key takeaways for this video
Learning AI:
Here are the key takeaways from the video "Busting myths and finding time":


Coaching is not handholding: It's about setting clear expectations and goals, guiding, questioning, and prompting employees to take ownership of their work and careers.
Time management: Coaching can save time in the long run by making teams more autonomous and efficient, reducing the need for backtracking and firefighting.
Employee retention: Growing your people doesn't mean you'll lose them. Providing growth opportunities can actually increase engagement and reduce turnover.
Shared responsibility: While employees are responsible for driving their careers, managers play a crucial role in unlocking their strengths and helping them grow.

The video also suggests practical steps like letting go of myths, identifying people to coach, and scheduling regular coaching sessions.
